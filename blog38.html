<p>Any firm that sells material goods need barcodes. Barcodes make logistic procedures more efficient and decrease human mistakes in contemporary transportation. They're used in warehouses to keep track of goods and parcels, by shipping companies to identify and track shipments, and occasionally on invoices to help with bookkeeping.</p>

<br>
<p>With the usage of barcodes, the business integration process in supply chain management has become simpler and more helpful. It's a useful identifying tool for tracking items and reducing mistakes. Barcode technology in inventory management is beneficial for timely and accurate information, greater warehouse efficiency, and lesser inventory on hand.</p>
<p>Modern shipping and incoming and outbound logistics systems would be inefficient and error-prone without barcodes. Barcodes are used by third-party logistics businesses (also known as 3PLs) to manage their warehouses effectively so that they may better serve the corporations for whom they provide fulfillment services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 600;">We'll go through why 3PLs use shipping barcodes and why you should, too, in this guide on utilizing shipping barcodes in the logistics sector.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="main-headd">Shipping barcode in logistics industry</h2>
<br>
<p>A shipping barcode is a label that is printed and adhered to a box, and it is scanned at each stage of the delivery process to identify the goods as it moves from the manufacturer or fulfillment center to the end consumer.</p>
<div class="center">

</div>
<br>
<p>Machines scan barcodes to retrieve information on the shipment, such as the customer's name, contents in the box, shipping method, and delivery address.</p>

<div class="ul2d greybgd">
<div class="ul2-headd">In the logistics business, updating barcodes has several advantages. The following are some of them:</div>
<ul>
<li><span>Lower expenses </span></li>
<li><span>Higher read rates </span></li>
<li><span>Increased productivity</span></li>
<li><span>Better real-time visibility</span></li>
<li><span>Inventory scheduling and tracking</span></li>
<li><span>Fewer customer contacts since they can follow their shipments</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<h2 class="main-headd">A barcodeâ€™s journey in logistics industry</h2>
<br>
<p>Almost every stage in the supply chain involves barcodes. They're there both when a product is sent from the producer and when it reaches the end-user.</p>
<br>
<div class="inner-divd">
<div class="main-head2d">1. When the producer sends out the product</div>
<br>
<p>A shipping barcode will be appended to the label when inventory batches are ready to be delivered from the manufacturer to their next destination.</p>
<br>
<div class="main-head2d">2. The arrival of the product at the warehouse</div>
<br>
<p>Warehouse personnel receives inventory and scan it in upon arrival to check that the items and quantities promised by the merchant arrived as promised.</p>
<br>
<div class="main-head2d">3. Retrieval of the product from its storage location</div>
<br>
<p>The order's picker will know exactly where to obtain the ordered item(s) and quantities. The picker will scan the product and/or location identification when they arrive at the inventory location.</p>
<br>
<div class="main-head2d">4. Picking packages at a warehouse</div>
<br>
<p>A label is applied to the box or mailer once an order has been packaged. Pickups at warehouses will be made by shipping carriers, who should scan the shipment before leaving the facility. This might indicate that the shipment has been sent out and is on its way.</p>
<br>
<div class="main-head2d">5. While the cargo is on its way</div>
<br>
<p>The carrier should scan the package when it is delivered to gain a more exact image of its location, which is especially useful if it is delayed for whatever reason. It should be scanned at a nearby facility before starting its trip to the consumer for last-mile delivery.</p>
<br>
<div class="main-head2d">6. The product arrived at its destination.</div>
<br>
<p>When a package reaches its ultimate destination, the carrier will scan it one more time to ensure that it has arrived safely. The client should have received the order at this point. If a delivery effort fails, the package may be returned to a nearby sorting facility until a new delivery attempt is possible.</p>

<h2 class="main-headd">3PL's usage of multiple barcodes</h2>
<br>
<p>Barcodes are a great tool to assist your warehouse to extend its operations and aid this expansion if your firm is growing and you are contemplating or already using 3PL (Third Party Logistics) services.</p>
<p>To deliver orders efficiently, third-party logistics businesses rely largely on shipping barcodes. Here are a few examples of how 3PLs use shipping barcodes.</p>
<br>
<div class="inner-divd">
<div class="main-head2d">Receiving inventory </div>
<br>
<p>Before being stored or forwarded to the next phase, all merchandise received from manufacturers or suppliers is scanned with a barcode scanner. Each 3PL firm has a system in place for receiving inventory.</p>
<br>
<div class="main-head2d">Distributing orders to courier companies</div>
<br>
<p>Orders are chosen and packed in the fulfillment facility in preparation for delivery. A shipping barcode will be put on the outside of each box. After scanning the package before leaving the facility, the 3PL will transfer it over to a courier firm for delivery.</p>
<br>
<div class="main-head2d">End-customer return orders are received.</div>
<br>
<p>Return orders occur for a variety of reasons. The procedure differs from one retailer to the next. However, in this situation, your 3PL provider also handles return orders, which they scan before accepting.</p>
</div>
<br>
<h2 class="main-headd">3PL encounters and scans two types of barcodes.</h2>
<br>
<div class="inner-divd">
<div class="main-head2d">Shipping barcodes</div>
<br>
<p>These are commonly found on shipping labels or receipts. 3PL examines incoming merchandise and outgoing shipments before courier carriers pick them up for delivery. In fulfillment centers, barcode scanning makes it simple to see when stock is running low and refill to meet the client's delivery deadlines.</p>
<br>
<div class="main-head2d">Product barcodes</div>
<br>
<p>In a 3PL facility, accuracy in product sorting and packing is critical. In warehouses, location barcodes or QR codes for shelves aid in the most efficient use of storage space. Because most 3PLs work with several brands to guarantee the proper product is packed and dispatched on time, product barcodes help with efficiency in the fulfillment center.</p>
